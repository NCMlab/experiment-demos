# experiment-demos

Repository for hosting **working experiments** created in jsPsych. Experiments should be based on already published work, with an emphasis on well-known/influential studies - this is not the place for new studies. The goal is two-fold:
1. **Supporting Education in Experimental Psychology** by providing a set of experiments that can be hosted online so that students can run each other in lab and programming courses.   
1. **Supporting new research with jsPsych** by provide inspiration and a starting point for researchers interested in using jsPsych to develop new studies.
