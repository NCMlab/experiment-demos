# experiment-demos

Repository for hosting **working experiments** created in jsPsych. 

Experiments should be based on already published work, with an emphasis on well-known/influential studies - this is not the place for new studies. 

The goal is two-fold:
1. *Supporting Education in Experimental Psychology* by providing a set of experiments that can be hosted online so that students can run each other in lab and programming courses.   
1. *Supporting new research with jsPsych* by providing inspiration and a starting point for researchers interested in using jsPsych to develop new studies. 

## How Do I Contribute a Study?
1. Raise an issue [here](https://github.com/jspsych/experiment-demos/issues). Provide enough detail so that your other contributors can know which experiment you are planning to do. Apply label "DemoTaskDevelopment". Assign yourself to the issue.   
1. Make a pull request. Other contributors may reach out to you about adaptating or optimizing the experiment.
