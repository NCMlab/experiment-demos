<b>Experiment name:</b> CFMT faces experiment

<b>Who wrote it:</b> Andreja Stajduhar 

<b>Background:</b> The following study is the full length Cambridge Face Memory Test (CFMT), comprised of six target faces and a total of ## trials. Here, participants will first complete the CFMT with upright masked faces followed by the same experiment, this time with inverted masked faces.

A version of this experiment was originally conducted for our study exploring face recognition performance during the COVID-19 pandemic:

<b>Task description:</b> The first level of the CFMT involves showing six target faces from three different viewpoints (right, front, left) for 3 seconds each. Participants are then asked to identify the face they have previously seen from a choice of three (3-alternative forced choice task). The second level involves simultaneous refresher of the six faces from one (frontal) viewpoint followed by testing from novel viewpoints and lighting conditions. The third (difficult) phase is similar to the second phase but includes test images with added visual noise.

<b>Results file info:</b> Beyond the standard data saved by each of the plugins (stimulus, rt, response, etc.), an additional 'difficulty' parameter was added to each trial to record difficulty level (easy, medium, hard).

<b>Experimental set-up:</b> block design

<b>Stimuli:<b> Caucasian male faces

<b>Modifiable parameters:</b> All parameters are technically modifiable.
